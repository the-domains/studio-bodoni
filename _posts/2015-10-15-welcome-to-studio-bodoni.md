# Welcome to Studio Bodoni

I am 28, married to a wonderful woman and currently live in Hamburg, Germany. Throughout the years, I have lived in the US, China, Denmark, Germany, Hungary and Romania. Yes, you guessed it, I love to travel and get to know new people, explore new places, cultures and just try to experience all that this world has to offer.

Inquisitive and active by nature, I got my first stitches at the tender age of 1 after running, slipping and falling in the house. Now I try to keep the physical injuries to a minimum but my curiosity and energy levels have not diminished. Snowboarding keeps me happy in the winter and biking in the summer; photography, the Rubik's cube and woodworking all year long.

I am driven both professionally and personally and love to achieve things I have set my mind on. My education is in computer sciences and economic consulting. The professional work I have done ranges, from quality management to consulting and sales.

Things that are really important to me are my family and friends. Knowing in my heart where I belong and enjoying a healthy, happy life to the fullest extent possible.
